## In javascript we don't have to define datatype for the spefic variable, same as in python.
 
# Variable = Data container


Java script variable can be defined in 4 ways.

### Modern Javascript
1. Using Let
    Most often you will assign a value to the variable when you declare i

2. Using const
    Always use const if you don't want the value to be changed in future.

### Traditinal Javascript

3. using var for Variables
    The var keyword was used in javascript before 2015 only. Never use var if you can use const and let.

4. Automatically not recommended
    When we don't put any keyword like var, const, let before variable, its just a informal way to create variable, cause if the same name varaiable arrives then the value will be overwritten to same variable and count as one.
